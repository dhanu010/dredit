This project is designed as a curricular activity for Course CSC 230 - System Software Engineering 
at Sacramento State University Master's program.

The developers had come up with a idea of a web-based tool that helps user to manage their credit card debt at one place. 
Problem Statement: Everybody has credit cards, and we know how it is difficult to manage credit card payments, interest paid and current debt. so we decided to address this problem and here is our problem statement -
"Keeping track of payments made, interest, outstanding balance for credit cards on an ongoing basis is a manual, tedious and time-consuming task."

Proposed Solution: Our application “Credit Card Debt Viewer” will help users to manage their credit card data at ONE place. 
(NO need to look into each credit card website)
User needs to login with their gmail account to access the application.
User can not only add his/her credit card data but can also see reports generated by our application based on the information provided.

Methodologies Used:
Extended Existing DriveEdit example provided by Google (https://github.com/googledrive/dredit/tree/master/java)
Both DrEdit and Credit Card Debt Viewer runs on Google App Engine
We implemented this project using Agile Methodology (3-week Iterations, Iteration Retrospectives, Product Backlog)
We implemented our code that usees Google Drive REST API and Google Spreadsheet REST API to handle user request of adding a credit card useing our application.
We devloped using Java Servlets, HTML5, CSS, AngularJS, JQuery and AJAX.

Besides DrEdit's code, to develop Credit Card Debt viewer here are our code contributions:
Files Modified: Index.html, app.css (UI), controller.js, services.js (Logic, data validation), web.xml and
appengine-web.xml, client_secret.json (Application-Related Setting)
Created New Helper class to handle spreadsheets: SpreadsheetHandler.java (Google Spreadsheet API to read and write to spreadsheet)
Created New servlets classes: CCAddPaymentServlet.java, CCReportServlet.java, GenerateCreditCardDropDownServlet.java and InsertSpreadsheetServlet.java

We have implemented this using open source DriveEdit application. So we decided to make our code also open source for public to use and extend.
Here are our suggestions if someone is looking for extending Credit Card Debt Viewer Application:
Display reports on the same screen, instead of Report file.
Add more report types: Report that looks for trends: is outstanding balance increasing or decreasing?, Report to suggest debt reduction plans
Finally an iOS and android app.

We hope that this readme file help you in understanding the project.

Warm Regards,
Avani Rajopadhye & Juan Garcia
